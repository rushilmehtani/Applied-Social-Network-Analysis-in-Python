3. - If we draw a power law distribution in log-log scale, the distribution will look like a straight line.
   - The Preferential Attachment Model generates a network with a power law degree distribution.

4. - In the small-world model starting with k nearest neighbors, increasing the rewiring probability p generally decreases both the average clustering coecient and average shortest path.
   - The degree distribution of small-world networks follows power-law distribution.

5. Average local clustering coecient will increase and average shortest path will decrease.
