5. - The assumption of degree centrality is that important nodes have more connections.
   - We can use subsets of node-pairs to approximate betweenness centrality.

6. - Adding out-links of a node will always decrease its PR.
   - The authority and hub score of each node is obtained by computing multiple iterations of HITS algorithm and both scores of most networks are convergent.

10. Node D’s authority and hub score after k iterations (k>=1) are always 0.
