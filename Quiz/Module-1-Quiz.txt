1. - Weighted networks are used to describe networks with unequal relationships between nodes.
   - An undirected graph is a good choice to present a network with asymmetric relationships between nodes.
   - When there are only two opposite relationships between nodes, a signed network is a good representation.

2. Multigraph

3. Directed Weighted Network

4. - Edges can carry many labels or attributes
   - Accessing node or edge attributes in NetworkX is the same as accessing values in a Python dictionary
   - Suppose we have created a nx.Graph()object G with some nodes and edges. The statement G.nodes(data=True) will return a list of tuples.

5. Dictionary

6. G.edge['A']['B'][0]['relation']
